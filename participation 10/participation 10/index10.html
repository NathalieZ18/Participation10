<p>When I first started thinking about how to design a font, I aimed for a style that was simple and playful, like a doodle. Although I tried just about everything to solve it, using the modulator in the planning stages revealed that it would ultimately fill in the gaps, which was not what I had in mind. In the end, I settled on a typeface that looked like it could have been used for computer code because I thought it would give a sense of cyberspace. I made the unit wider while reducing the height of the cap as much as possible. I also experimented with decreasing the x-height and increasing the y-height. In terms of optical adjustments, nearly everything is at its default value of 0. Surprisingly, I'm happy with the result... Although now that I'm looking at it I'm starting to get reminded of the Papyrus font...</p>
